**Research Focus**: By using IDT modality, recover better 3D RI using a deep learning framework. 

**Methodology**: 
- Traditional IDT and uses only the intensity image obtained with different light directions to reconstruct the RI.
- A former work by Prof. Yi Xue introduced BRIEF to combine fluorescence imaging with IDT, exciting a fluorescent point to light up the upper samples, and used FISTA to compute gradient and do backward updates.
- NeRFâ€™s MLP layers were adopted to compute a 1 channel output as input for RI, a rendering process of multislice model was used to process the RI into intensity image, then loss was computed and trained.

**Performance**: Can now reconstruct intensity on simulated data, need improvement on RI.
